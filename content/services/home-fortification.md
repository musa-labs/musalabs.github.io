## Your Home is Your Castle. Is it Secure?

Your home Wi-Fi is the gateway to your entire digital life. With more smart devices than ever—from doorbells to thermostats—the risk of someone breaking in digitally is real.

### Why Fortify Your Home Network?

- **Work from Home Safely**: Keep your client's data safe, even when working from the kitchen table.
- **Privacy First**: Stop smart devices from recording more than they should.
- **Child Safety**: Automatically block dangerous or adult websites on your kids' tablets.

### What We Do

#### We Separate the Traffic
We create different "lanes" for your internet. Your work computer shouldn't be in the same lane as a cheap smart lightbulb that hasn't been updated in years.

#### We Harden the Hardware
We change default passwords (which hackers know) to strong ones, and turn off insecure features you don't need.
