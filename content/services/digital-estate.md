## Don't Leave Your Family Locked Out

If something happened to you today, would your spouse or children know how to unlock your phone? Would they know where your life insurance policy is saved?

Our Digital Estate Planning service takes the stress out of these questions. We help you organize your digital life so you can focus on enjoying it.

### Why This Matters

- **Save Your Photos**: Don't let years of family memories vanish in a clouded account no one can access.
- **Avoid Legal Headaches**: Make it easy for your family to handle your affairs without fighting tech support.
- **Peace of Mind**: Know that no matter what happens, your loved ones are taken care of.

### How We Help

#### 1. We Sit Down Together
We talk through what you have online. Email, social media, crypto, banking—we list it all.

#### 2. We Set Up "Emergency Keys"
We use the features already built into your accounts to name a trusted person who can access them if you aren't active for a set time.

#### 3. We Create a "Break Glass" Plan
We give you a secure physical and digital instruction manual for your family. You put it in your safe, and relax.
