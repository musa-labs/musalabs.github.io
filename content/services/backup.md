## Your Digital Safety Net

Hard drives break. Laptops get stolen. Viruses happen. Our Backup service makes sure that no matter what happens to the machine, your memories and hard work are safe.

### Why Not Just Use Dropbox or iCloud?

Cloud storage is great for sharing, but it's not a true backup. If you accidentally delete a file in Dropbox, it's gone from the cloud too. If a virus hits your computer, it spreads to the cloud.

**Our backup is different.** It keeps a history of your files. We can go back in time to yesterday, last week, or last month—before the problem happened.

### How It Works

#### 1. We Install a Tiny App
It runs quietly in the background and doesn't slow you down.

#### 2. It Saves Everything
Every photo, every document, every email. It happens automatically.

#### 3. You Relax
We check it every day to make sure it's working. You never have to remember to "run a backup" again.
