### Introduction

Staying secure online these days is more than having a good password. With the amount of data breaches taking place, it's possible that you'll find your personal information and password in what they call a Dump or Data Dump. 

> A Data Dump is where an attacker has successfully compromised a website like Gmail and has extracted the usernames and passwords.

You might be wondering "Has an account of mine been found in one of these Data Dumps?". Luckily there's an awesome site called [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) that tracks if your email has shown up in any of the dumps.

My email address has found itself in a dump more than a few times.

**Have I Been Pwned** will also tell you what kind of data was discovered in the dump. This will give you a good idea if you should change your password for the service.


Another critical point to think about.

**Are you using the same password for different services?**

A large majority of why people's accounts get hacked is through password reuse. One password is found in a data dump and tested on every other site. 


### Password Management

This is where a password manager comes into play. 

Password Managers work by using one password to unlock a vault of all your other passwords. Managers can run on your phone, laptop and even your browser. Think Lord of the Rings, one password to rule them all.  


Most if not all managers have a password generator you can use.
Instead of coming up with a password, pass that responsibility off to the password manager. 

I never think about the password I generate. I make sure its long and complex enough and ensure I have it saved in my password manager. Password Managers take the burden off your brain and increase the security of your accounts in one place. 


### Actionable Steps

Try some password managers

I personally use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)

You can also checkout
- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass)

When making a password for your manager leverage a passphrase. A passphrase is a long, memorable, and secure series of words (and sometimes numbers or symbols). Generally more secure and easier to remember.

Example Passphrase: `MySecurePassphraseThatYoullNeverGuess123!!!`
